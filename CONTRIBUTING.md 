## I Want To Contribute

### Security Issues
You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to security@sayfer.io



### Reporting Bugs
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:
- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

## Your First Code Contribution

You can also reach our to the project team and ask for help. We are happy to help you get started.
